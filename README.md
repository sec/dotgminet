- Quick and dirty implementation of Gemini protocol server.
- Files are served from `public` directory, next to binary.
- Support `text/gemini` based on `.gmi` extension (client can request `/file` or `/file.gmi`).
- Other file are served directly, with MIME type based on extension.
- Uses `` for server certificate.
- Hardcoded on purpose
